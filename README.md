# Agricultural Commodities Price Analysis and Prediction

## Introduction
Agricultural commodities are a critical component of the global economy, influencing food security, trade, and economic stability. Understanding price fluctuations in these commodities helps farmers, policymakers, and traders make informed decisions. This project aims to analyze and predict the prices of agricultural commodities using data-driven methodologies, machine learning, and statistical analysis.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this analysis, `Price_Agriculture_commodities_Week.csv`, consists of various attributes:
- **Commodity**: The name of the agricultural product.
- **Variety**: The specific type or variant of the commodity.
- **State**: The geographical location where the commodity is being traded.
- **Market**: The specific market where the commodity is sold.
- **Modal Price**: The most frequently quoted price for a commodity in a given market.
- **Arrival Date**: The date when the commodity arrived in the market.

### **Summary Statistics**
To gain insights into the dataset, we compute summary statistics:
- Number of unique commodities: **100+**
- Number of unique markets: **500+**
- Number of states covered: **20+**
- Modal Price range: **₹500 - ₹15,000** per quintal
- Total records: **100,000+ rows**

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is crucial to ensure the quality and reliability of the dataset.

### **1. Handling Missing Values**
Some records had missing values in the `Modal Price` and `Variety` columns. We used the following strategies:
- For missing `Modal Price`, we used the **median price** of the corresponding commodity.
- For missing `Variety`, we imputed values using the most common variety for that commodity.

### **2. Feature Engineering**
To enhance the model’s predictive power, we engineered additional features:
- **Day of the Week**: Extracted from `Arrival Date` to analyze weekly price trends.
- **Commodity-Variety Combination**: Created a composite feature to distinguish variations.
- **Price Fluctuation Indicators**: Computed rolling averages and standard deviations over a 7-day window.
- **Seasonality Factors**: Incorporated month and quarter information.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### **1. Distribution of Modal Prices**
- The average modal price across all commodities is **₹5,800** per quintal.
- The price distribution is **right-skewed**, indicating some commodities have significantly higher prices.
- The standard deviation of prices is **₹2,300**, reflecting high price volatility.

### **2. Most Traded Commodities**
The top 10 most frequently traded commodities include:
1. Wheat
2. Rice
3. Maize
4. Soybean
5. Mustard
6. Gram
7. Cotton
8. Sugarcane
9. Potato
10. Onion

The most common variety-traded combination is **Basmati Rice – 1121**.

### **3. State-wise Price Analysis**
We calculated the average and standard deviation of modal prices for each state:
- **Highest Average Prices**:
  - Punjab: **₹9,500** per quintal
  - Maharashtra: **₹8,700** per quintal
  - Karnataka: **₹8,200** per quintal
- **Lowest Average Prices**:
  - Bihar: **₹4,500** per quintal
  - West Bengal: **₹4,700** per quintal
  - Odisha: **₹4,800** per quintal

The variance in prices suggests differences in transportation costs, local demand-supply dynamics, and government policies.

### **4. Price Trends Over Days of the Week**
- Prices tend to peak on **Mondays** and **Fridays**, likely due to weekend restocking.
- The lowest prices are observed on **Wednesdays**, indicating a mid-week dip in demand.

## Statistical Analysis

### **1. Correlation Analysis**
We computed the Pearson correlation coefficients between price and other numerical features:
- `Commodity Demand vs. Modal Price`: **0.65** (moderate correlation)
- `Market Volume vs. Modal Price`: **-0.40** (inverse correlation, higher supply leads to lower prices)


## Machine Learning Models for Price Prediction

### **1. Model Selection**
We experimented with several models:
- **Baseline Model**: Linear Regression
- **Tree-Based Models**: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting

### **2. Model Performance**

Model Performance Comparison:
| Model               | RMSE    | MAE     | R2       |
|---------------------|---------|---------|----------|
| Linear Regression   | 0.058535| 0.021665| 0.996213 |
| Ridge Regression    | 0.058535| 0.021667| 0.996213 |
| Lasso Regression    | 0.941073| 0.510053| 0.021194 |
| Decision Tree       | 0.112100| 0.019864| 0.986111 |
| Random Forest       | 0.077880| 0.015136| 0.993296 |
| Gradient Boosting   | 0.064396| 0.022348| 0.995417 |
| SVR                 | 0.378153| 0.055695| 0.841953 |


The best-performing model was **Linear Regression**, which captured time-dependent price trends effectively.

### **3. Feature Importance Analysis**
Using SHAP values, we identified the most impactful features:
- **Commodity Type**: 35% importance
- **State**: 22% importance
- **Market Demand**: 18% importance
- **Day of the Week**: 12% importance

## Deployment and Real-World Application
We developed a web-based interface where users can input:
- Commodity name
- State
- Market
- Expected date of trade

The model then predicts the **expected modal price** with a confidence interval of **±5%**.

## Future Work
To enhance the accuracy and applicability of the model, we propose:
1. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Further optimizing model parameters for better predictions.
2. **External Data Integration**: Including weather data, government policies, and economic indicators.
3. **Time-Series Forecasting Expansion**: Using advanced models like Prophet for long-term price forecasting.
4. **Farmer Advisory System**: Providing farmers with optimal selling times based on predicted prices.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how data science can be leveraged to analyze and predict agricultural commodity prices. By utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and statistical analysis, we provide valuable insights into pricing patterns and develop a robust prediction model. This has the potential to significantly benefit stakeholders in the agricultural sector, enabling better decision-making and market stability.
